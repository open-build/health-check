## Buildly Community Source License V1 (No Redistribution)

# TERMS AND CONDITIONS
## Definitions.
"This License" refers to version 1 of the Buildly Community Source License.


# 1. Source Code.
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.  All source code
is covered by this license that is contained in the structure from the license file and below.  Third party libraries and additional software licenses contained in 
sub directories or imported during or before run time of this code are not covered by this license unless otherwise stated.

# 2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the code, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified code. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License
only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent,
as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey
covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,
provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the
covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.

# 3. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, as long as that code is not made available in a publicly accessible way.
Internal development, test or other instances are allowed as well as password or otherwise protected public servers as long as it's limited to developers
or other editors of the content and is not done so in exchange for financial or otherwise reimbursement.
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

# 4. Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License. Section 5 may allow for overwrite of this requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 5 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

# 5. Compensation
Any work covered under the license is redistributable based on the agreement as source code for reference only, and not for use in a production or public system.
However, this clause may be overridden by contract or agreement for compensation.  In that case the agreement will include the distribution of one and only one production instance
and/or rebranding of the original software without attribution.
